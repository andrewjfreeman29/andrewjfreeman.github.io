          <h3>Core Four Leading Canes XC</h3>
          <h4>By Andrew J Freeman</h4>
          <p>CORAL GABLES, Fla. – The University of Miami is one of the most recognizable brands in college athletics. With so much success across so many different sports, Hurricanes student-athletes have developed a reputation of excellence. While most casual Hurricanes fans are mainly familiar with the storied traditions in football and baseball, four cross country runners are changing the culture in Coral Gables and making a name for themselves, and the program, in the process.</p>

          <h3>Time to Shine</h3>
          <h4>By Andrew J Freeman</h4>
          <p> It doesn't take long to realize that Jaquan Johnson knows what it means to be a Miami Hurricane football player. After all, this is his hometown team, and this fall the hard-hitting safety out of Miami Killian High School will get his chance to shine.“I'm looking forward to going out and winning, every game,” Johnson said. “That's the standard we have here at the University of Miami and that's how our whole team is thinking on the defense, just swarm to the ball.”</p>
